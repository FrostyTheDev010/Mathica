Mathica - A Mathematical Toolkit App
Mathcia is a mobile application built using Python and the Kivy framework. It provides a suite of mathematical tools, including number analysis, two-number relationships, a calculator, and an equation solver. This app is designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and perfect for students, educators, and anyone who loves math!

Features
1. Number Properties
Analyze a single number to determine:

Whether it's prime

Its parity (even or odd)

Its prime factors

All divisors

2. Two Numbers Analysis
Compare two numbers to find:

Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)

Least Common Multiple (LCM)

Prime factors of each number

3. Calculator
Perform basic arithmetic operations

Supports advanced functions like square roots (âˆš), exponents (^), and constants like Ï€

Clear (AC) and backspace (âŒ«) functionality

4. Equation Solver
Solve linear and quadratic equations

Step-by-step solution display

Supports symbols like âˆš, Ï€, and e
